--------------------
General information:
--------------------

The content of this repository corresponds to the content of O2_GPL_acR4311.rar file, which is provided within the HomeBox 2 6441 (1.01.30) GPL-Release by Arcadyan (Astoria).

Out-of-the-box this content is unusable! Following main points were found:

- missing (external) toolchain!
- HELL of permission errors (all files within the .rar archive have 0644 permission)
- missing symlinks
- missing files (in kernel-folder)

Before the initial commit most of the permission errors were fixed. It is not known if there are more (because I only diffed to an older Release of a Quantenna GPL Release (for Netgear R7500), with another target).


-----------------------------
Missing (external toolchain):
-----------------------------

To obtain (the pre-compiled, external) toolchain you can either inquire it from Arcadyan (Astoria), mail to opensource@arcadyan.com, or you can use one from another QTN-based/QTN-using device, like Netgear R7500 (URL: http://www.downloads.netgear.com/files/GPL/R7500-and_qtn_gpl_src_V1.0.0.94.zip) or ZyXEL VMG9823-B10A (you have to inquire it yourself)

For testing and compilation of this source code the external toolchain from Netgear's R7500 was used. You need the QEnvInstaller.bin file (rename it to Qenvinstaller.bin) from the Quantenna GPL tarball.


----------------------
Howto install/compile:
----------------------

1. git clone https://github.com/christianheyl/Quantenna-GPL.git quantenna-GPL
2. cd quantenna-GPL
3. copy Qenvinstaller.bin to this folder
4. chmod a+x Qenvinstaller.bin
5. ./Qenvinstaller.bin
6. make topaz_rgmii_config
7. make fromscratch

Note!: You might need to sudo (step 4 and 5) to install the toolchain. After installation it's located in '/usr/local/ARC/gcc/'

For debug logs, while building, you can use 'make V=99'. After build is completed, all built files can be found in tftp-folder.
