The content of this repository corresponds to the content of O2_GPL_acR4311.rar file, which is provided within the HomeBox 2 6441 (1.01.30) GPL-Release by Arcadyan (Astoria).

Out-of-the-box this content is unusable! Following main points where found:

- missing (external) toolchain!
- HELL of permission errors (all files within the .rar archive have 0644 permission)
- missing symlinks
- missing files (in kernel-folder)

Before the initial commit most of the permission errors were fixed. It is not known if there are more (because I only diffed to an older Release of a Quantenna GPL Release (for Netgear R7500) with another target).
